                    Welcome to my personal Portfolio. I am a data scientist with passion about discoveries based on data analyses, programming and football. Ever since 
                    I was a kid, I loved understanding how various devices functioned and I liked to press buttons on devices in order to observe the 
                    functioal changes. In my first ever coding project, I wrote a python programme that captured bytes, 
                    serially transmitted from a pulse oximeter module, decode them and printed the output to a monitor. This programme ran on a raspberry pi. I also implemented 
                    functionanilities to enable various interactions between the pulse oximeter and a user. Being able to control the behaviour of an electronic device using a 
                    self-written programme was very fascinating for me. I subsequently combined my newly learned coding skills with my passion 
                    for statistics to go into data science. I look forward to broaden my horizons. This portfolio website is a work in progess and will be upgraded and updated progressively.
